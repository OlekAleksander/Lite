# Lite Client V2

Credits to all lite developers. I didnt make the client. I just forked it for archival purposes.

# Setting Up
* Main Class
```
net.minecraft.Start
```
* Working Directory
```
%PATH_TO_PROJECT%\maven-mcp\workspace\
```
* VM options
```
For VM options you have to use natives, dependent on what operating system you are running

This is the basic VM options that you can use:

-Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives

and you append -win for windows or -mac for mac onto the end of the natives

Windows: -Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives-win
Mac: -Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives-mac
Linux: -Djava.library.path=versionss\1.8.8s\1.8.8-natives-linux
```
